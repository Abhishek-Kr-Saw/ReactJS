Project Overview and Goal
-------------------------
The video focuses on building a functional React application using React Router DOM to demonstrate routing, rather than just creating UI clones.
The project aims to teach essential React Router concepts through a practical example, including navigation between different pages and handling dynamic URLs.

Key Features of the Demo Application
------------------------------------
- Navigation Bar and Footer: These elements remain consistent across different pages, while only the inner content changes.
- About and Contact Pages: Standard static pages demonstrating basic routing.
- GitHub Link: Fetches data from an API (e.g., follower count, profile image) to display dynamic content.
- Dynamic Parameters: Captures values directly from the URL (e.g., /myparams/123), allowing for dynamic content based on the URL segment.

React Router DOM: A Third-Party Library
----------------------------------------
React Router DOM is a third-party library, not a core part of React, and is essential for handling routing in React applications.
The video covers its installation and configuration, noting changes especially in version 6.4.

Core Routing Components and Concepts
------------------------------------
- Link vs. NavLink:
  * Link: Used instead of <a> to prevent full page reloads (essential for SPAs).
  * NavLink: Like Link, but allows styling based on the active route (e.g., using isActive).

- Layout Component and Outlet:
  * A Layout component defines a shared structure (like headers/footers).
  * The <Outlet /> renders the specific route content dynamically inside that layout.

Defining Routes
---------------
Routes can be defined in two main ways:
1. Array of Route Objects:
   - Use `createBrowserRouter()` with an array of route objects.
   - Each object defines `path`, `element`, and optionally `children` for nested routes.

2. JSX Route Definitions:
   - Use `createRoutesFromElements()` with JSX-like `<Route>` components.
   - Often more readable and intuitive, especially for nested routes.

Handling Dynamic Data
---------------------
- Dynamic URL Parameters:
  * The `useParams()` hook retrieves dynamic values (like ID) from the URL.

- Data Fetching with Loaders:
  * Loaders fetch data before rendering the component.
  * `useLoaderData()` accesses this data in the component.
  * Improves UX by starting data fetching as soon as the user hovers over a link.

Additional Notes
----------------
- React Router is key for navigation in React SPAs.
- Version 6.4 introduced major changes (e.g., loaders, actions, nested routing improvements).
- Learn to structure apps with reusable layouts and efficient data loading strategies.
