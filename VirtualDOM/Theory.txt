What is Virtual DOM?

Virtual DOM (VDOM) is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the real DOM used in libraries like React to improve performance.

Simply:
- DOM (Document Object Model) is how browsers represent HTML elements.
- Updating the real DOM is slow.
- So, Virtual DOM acts as a middle layer between your code and the real DOM.

How It Works:
1. Render: React creates a virtual DOM tree from components.
2. Diffing: On updates, React compares the new VDOM with the previous one (called diffing).
3. Update: Only the parts that changed are updated in the real DOM (called reconciliation).

Advantages:
- Faster updates
- Better performance
- Clean and predictable UI rendering

Example Analogy:
Think of Virtual DOM like a blueprint. You modify the blueprint, and React updates only the necessary parts of the actual building (webpage).
