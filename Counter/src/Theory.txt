React Hooks & Counter App – Quick Revision

- Why Hooks?
  - Regular JavaScript variables don’t update the React UI.
  - React uses "Hooks" like useState to manage data and trigger UI updates.

- useState Hook
  - Syntax: const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);
  - Use setState(newVal) to update and re-render the UI.
  - Never modify the state directly (e.g., counter = counter + 1 is incorrect).

- Project Setup (Vite)
  - Create project: npm create vite@latest
  - Install dependencies: npm install
  - Run the dev server: npm run dev
  - Clean the App.jsx file for a fresh start

- Counter App Flow
  - Display counter value and two buttons (increase and decrease).
  - Problem: Using a let variable updates in the console but not on the UI.
  - Solution: Use useState and update using setCounter.

- Bonus: Prevent Invalid Counts
  - Add condition to prevent the counter from going below 0 or above 20.

- Summary
  - Always use useState for values that affect the UI.
  - setState triggers React to re-render the component.
