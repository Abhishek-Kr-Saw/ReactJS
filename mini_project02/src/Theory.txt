Project Setup and State Management
The project begins with a basic setup using Vite for the React application and Tailwind CSS for styling, which are fundamental steps for those familiar with the series.

Key application states are managed using the useState hook to track dynamic values:
- length: This state manages the desired length of the generated password, with a default value of 8 characters.
- numberAllowed: A boolean state that determines whether numbers should be included in the password, defaulting to false.
- characterAllowed: A boolean state that controls the inclusion of special characters, also defaulting to false.
- password: This state stores the actual generated password string that is displayed to the user.

Password Generation Logic
A core passwordGenerator method is implemented to create the random password. This method constructs a pool of characters based on the numberAllowed and characterAllowed 
 states, including lowercase and uppercase alphabets, numbers, and special characters as selected by the user.
It then iteratively picks random characters from this pool for the specified length to form the final password.

Optimization with useCallback
The useCallback hook is introduced to optimize the passwordGenerator function by memoizing its definition. This prevents unnecessary re-creations of the function on every 
 re-render, improving performance.
The useCallback hook takes the function itself and a dependency array. The passwordGenerator function is re-memoized only when its dependencies change, which include length, 
 numberAllowed, characterAllowed, and setPassword. This ensures that the function is optimized while still reacting to relevant state changes.

Triggering Password Generation with useEffect
The useEffect hook is utilized to automatically generate a password when the page initially loads and whenever any of its specified dependencies change.
The dependencies for useEffect include length, numberAllowed, characterAllowed, and the passwordGenerator function itself. This ensures that the password is re-generated 
 dynamically as the user interacts with the length slider or checkboxes. The video clarifies the distinction between useCallback (optimizing the function definition) and useEffect 
 (running side effects based on dependencies).

Copying to Clipboard with useRef
The useRef hook is employed to gain direct access to the password input field in the DOM. This direct reference is crucial for performing actions like selecting the text within the input field.
A copyPasswordToClipboard function is created, which uses window.navigator.clipboard.writeText to copy the generated password to the user's clipboard. To enhance user experience, 
 passwordRef.current.select() is used to visually highlight the password in the input field when it is copied, providing immediate feedback to the user. Additionally, the setSelectionRange method 
 can be used to select a specific portion of the text within the input field.
