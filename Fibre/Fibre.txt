What is Fiber in React?

Fiber is the new reconciliation engine introduced in React 16. It’s the system behind how React updates the Virtual DOM and the real DOM efficiently.

Simply:
- React used to update everything synchronously, which could block the UI.
- Fiber allows React to break work into smaller chunks, so it can pause, resume, or cancel rendering tasks.

Think of it Like:
A to-do list where React does tasks step-by-step, instead of all at once — so your app stays responsive.

Key Features of Fiber:
- Incremental rendering: Updates can be split and paused.
- Prioritization: Important updates (like user input) happen first.
- Error handling: Better support for error boundaries.
- Concurrency: Enables features like React Concurrent Mode and Suspense.

Why Fiber Matters:
- Keeps UI smooth and responsive
- Makes advanced features like lazy loading, suspense, and concurrent rendering possible
- Improves performance and flexibility
