What is the Reconciliation Engine in React?

The Reconciliation Engine is the core algorithm in React that figures out what changed in the UI and updates the DOM efficiently.

Simply:
- When you update the state or props, React re-renders components.
- The reconciliation engine compares the new Virtual DOM with the old one.
- It then updates only the parts of the real DOM that changed — not the entire page.

Steps in Reconciliation:
1. Render: React builds a new Virtual DOM tree.
2. Diff: It compares the new tree with the old tree.
3. Update: It finds the minimal number of changes needed and updates the real DOM.

React’s Fiber architecture handles this reconciliation process with added benefits like pausing, prioritizing, and scheduling tasks.

Why It’s Important:
- Boosts performance
- Makes UI updates faster and smoother
- Avoids unnecessary DOM updates
