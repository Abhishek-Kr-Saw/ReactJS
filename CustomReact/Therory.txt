Building a Custom React - Summary Notes

1. Objective:
   The goal is to create a minimal version of React to understand its core workings and build confidence with how React functions under the hood.

2. Core Components:
   - index.html: Contains a basic HTML boilerplate with a <div id="root"></div> element.
   - customreact.js: A JavaScript file responsible for handling the logic similar to React.

3. React Element Structure:
   React (or your custom implementation) represents UI elements as plain JavaScript objects. These objects include:
   - type: The HTML tag (e.g., 'div', 'p', 'a')
   - props: An object of attributes (e.g., href, target)
   - children: The content or nested elements inside the component

4. Custom Render Method:
   A function named customRender is used to render the above elements into the DOM:
   Step-by-step process:
   - Step 1: Use document.createElement() to create a DOM node based on the 'type' field.
   - Step 2: Set its text content using innerHTML with the value from 'children'.
   - Step 3: Use setAttribute() to assign each key-value pair in 'props' as an attribute.
   - Step 4: Append this DOM node to the root container using appendChild().
